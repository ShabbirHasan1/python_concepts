    "# Python Introduction\n",
    "Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n",
    "- Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n",
    "- Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "- Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games."
