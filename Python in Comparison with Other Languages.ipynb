    "The most prevalent paradigm of Python is object-oriented programming (also\n",
    "known as OOP). It is centered around objects that encapsulate data (in the form\n",
    "of object attributes) and behavior (in the form of methods). OOP is probably one of the most diverse paradigms. It has many styles, flavors, and implementations that have been developed over many years of programming history. Python takes inspiration from many other languages. \n",
    "Lets take a look at the implementation of OOP in Python through the prism of different languages.\n",
    "# Comparisons w.r.t OOPs\n",
    "Python may not have as many object-oriented features as other OOP languages, but it has a pretty flexible data and class model that allows you to implement most OOP patterns with extreme elegance. Also, everything in Python is an object, including functions and class definitions and basic values like integers, floats, Booleans, and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few similarities with Kotlin\n",
    "Another popular programming language that has similar object-oriented syntax features and a similar data model, one of the closest matches would probably be Kotlin, which is a language that runs (mostly) on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The following are the similarities between Kotlin and Python:\n",
    "1. A convenient way to call methods of super-classes: Kotlin provides the super\n",
    "keyword and Python provides the super() function to explicitly reference\n",
    "methods or attributes of super-classes.\n",
    "2. An expression for object self-reference: Kotlin provides the this expression, which always references the current object of the class. In Python, the first argument of the method is always an instance reference. By convention, it is named self.\n",
    "3. The concept of properties: Kotlin allows you to define class property setters and getters as functions. Python provides the property() decorator with a similar purpose, together with the concept of descriptors, which allows you\n",
    "to fully customize the attribute access of an object.\n",
