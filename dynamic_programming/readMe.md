Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that helps you solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler recurring subproblems.
This is generally done by taking a recursive algorithm and finding the repeated calls, the results of which you can then store for future recursive calls.
Since you've compute the answer for an input and saved it for later,
you donâ€™t have to recompute it the next time around!
